#About Lambda

This is a demo site I've built using a pdf file found on the web. I wanted to practice the skills gained from FreeCodeCamp and through the internet. My thoughts on this project can be found on my blog: A Codepone Story (http://jungostudio.net).

###Want to help?
If you want to help feel free to do so. Since this is just a demo site to show my coding skills make sure to leave your comments within the code explaining why you change the code. Think of this as your feedback on my work. This will help with my learning process.
